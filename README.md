MacOS Tahoe removed launchpad,and it's so hard to use, it's doesn't use your Bio GPU, please apple, at least give people an option to switch back. Before that, here is LaunchNext

*Built upon [LaunchNow](https://github.com/ggkevinnnn/LaunchNow) by ggkevinnnn - huge thanks to the original project! I hope this enhanced version can be merged back to the original repository*

*LaunchNow has chosen the GPL 3 license. LaunchNext follows the same licensing terms.*

⚠️ **If macOS blocks the app, run this in Terminal:**
```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/LaunchNext.app
```
**Why**: I can't afford Apple's developer certificate ($99/year), so macOS blocks unsigned apps. This command removes the quarantine flag to let it run. **Only use this command on apps you trust.**

### What LaunchNext Delivers
- ✅ **One-click import from old system Launchpad** - directly reads your native Launchpad SQLite database (`/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db`) to perfectly recreate your existing folders, app positions, and layout
- ✅ **Classic Launchpad experience** - works exactly like the beloved original interface
- ✅ **Multi-language support** - full internationalization with English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Spanish, German, and Russian
- ✅ **Hide icon labels** - clean, minimalist view when you don't need app names
- ✅ **Custom icon sizes** - adjust icon dimensions to fit your preferences
- ✅ **Smart folder management** - create and organize folders just like before
- ✅ **Instant search and keyboard navigation** - find apps quickly

### What We Lost in macOS Tahoe
- ❌ No custom app organization
- ❌ No user-created folders
- ❌ No drag-and-drop customization
- ❌ No visual app management
- ❌ Forced categorical grouping


### Data Storage
Application data is safely stored in:
```
~/Library/Application Support/LaunchNext/Data.store
```

### Native Launchpad Integration
Reads directly from the system Launchpad database:
```bash
/private$(getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR)com.apple.dock.launchpad/db/db
```

## Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later (MacOS15 would work but some feedback said that you can not open folder, I can't test it.)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LaunchNext.git

### Development Guidelines

## The Future of App Management

As Apple moves away from customizable interfaces, LaunchNext represents the community's commitment to user control and personalization. I hope apple cound bring launchpad back.

**LaunchNext** isn't just a Launchpad replacement—it's a statement that user choice matters.
